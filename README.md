# 1. BoxApiFileProcessor
Integrates with Box.com api and adds details to files.


# 2. Google Sheets 
Currently integrates with google sheets.  Need to specify a file location for service account credentials.

# 3. Media Details extraction
Currently reads video and audio files with the MediaInfo.dll and extracts the duration property from the file.  This requries the service to download the file from box.com and then delete it.
